                    PhD studentships in the exciting and rapidly growing field of machine listening and audio processing.
                    Each project explores cutting-edge research areas including large audio models, audio enhancement,
                    and trustworthy audio processing—providing students with the opportunity to work at the forefront
                    of AI and audio technology. Detailed description of the projects are shown <a href="https://shengchenli.notion.site/phd-2026?source=copy_link" target="_blank">

                    Dr. Jacopo de Berardinis and Dr. Guangliang Cheng from University of Liverpool serve as
                    co-supervisors, alongside Prof. Mark D. Plumbley (IEEE Fellow) from King's College London as
